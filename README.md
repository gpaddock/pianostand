/musicdisplay -> take in music files of piano songs and determine the correct sequence of sounds that should be then be played back
/pianodisplay -> show the keys on the piano- envisioning a "learn" mode where you can watch the keys light up and then wait for playback
/soundeval -> connecting a usb mic to listen to the sounds played- may just use an audio input device as well and wire directly
